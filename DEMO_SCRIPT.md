# Course Correction — 3-Minute Demo Script

**Format**: Read aloud while screen-sharing the app. Pause markers [PAUSE] indicate where you click/wait for the UI. Aim for a calm, confident pace — you're showing, not selling.

---

## OPENING (15 seconds)

> Every training course starts decaying the moment it's published. Regulations change. Design trends move on. And before you know it, your 2022 OSHA module is citing standards that were updated two years ago — and your learners are staring at walls of text that look like they were built in PowerPoint '07.
>
> Course Correction fixes both problems at once.

[CLICK "Upload a course" or "Try the demo"]

## STEP 1 — MODE SELECT (10 seconds)

> We give you three options. You can do a Regulatory Update if you just need the facts checked. A Design Refresh if the content is fine but the format is dated. Or — what we'll do today — a **Full Refresh**, which is the complete overhaul: regulations *and* visual modernization, powered by six AI agents working in parallel.

[SELECT "Full Refresh" → CLICK "Continue"]

---

## STEP 2 — UPLOAD (10 seconds)

> We accept PDFs, PowerPoints, Word docs. I'm going to drop in an existing training course — this is a real course document, not a demo file.

[UPLOAD PDF → wait for progress bar to finish]

> That's it. One file, and we take it from here.

[CLICK "Continue"]

---

## STEP 3 — SECTOR & LOCATION (20 seconds)

> Now watch what happens. Course Correction is reading the document and doing its own analysis.

[PAUSE — let the four AI phases animate: Reading files → Identifying sector → Mapping topics → Building profile]

> It identified the sector automatically — and pulled out the key topics. We can adjust these if we want, but the AI nailed it. I'll confirm the location as United States so it checks against the right regulatory jurisdiction.

[VERIFY sector and location → CLICK "Continue"]

---

## STEP 4 — FINDINGS REVIEW (30 seconds)

> This is the two-stage scan. Stage one: the AI reads every page, cross-references against current standards using Google Search grounding, and surfaces what it finds.

[PAUSE — let the scan phases animate: Reading materials → Researching standards → Identifying opportunities]

> It found several issues. Now here's the key part — we don't just auto-fix everything. We show you each finding as a card and let you approve or skip it. This keeps the human in the loop.

[WALK THROUGH 2–3 finding cards, reading titles aloud]

> This one flagged an outdated compliance reference — severity high. I'll approve it. This one caught a design issue — the content would work better as an interactive timeline instead of a paragraph. Approved.

[APPROVE a few findings → CLICK "Continue" when review is complete]

---

## STEP 5 — STYLE SELECTION (15 seconds)

> Now we pick the look and feel. Six curated themes — I'll go with Midnight Bold for the high-contrast dark look. And Poppins for the font, which gives us a clean, geometric feel.

[SELECT theme → SELECT font → CLICK "Full Refresh"]

---

## STEP 6 — AGENT ORCHESTRATION (30 seconds)

> And here's where it gets interesting. Six specialized agents just spun up — all running in parallel on Gemini.

[PAUSE — let the 2x3 agent grid animate]

> The **Fact Checker** is verifying every claim against live sources using Google Search grounding. The **Slide Designer** is rebuilding the presentation with the approved findings. The **Study Guide Agent** is extracting key concepts and fact-checking them. The **Slide Deck Agent** is generating new slide content and picking the best slide for an AI-generated infographic. The **Quiz Agent** is waiting for the study guide to finish — because it builds questions directly from those sections, so the quiz and study guide are always aligned. And the **Course Summary** agent is mapping out objectives, difficulty level, and duration.

[WATCH agents complete one by one → "View Results" button appears]

> All six are done. Let's see what they built.

[CLICK "View Results"]

---

## RESULTS — REGULATORY TAB (25 seconds)

> Full Refresh gives us two output tabs. Regulatory Updates and Design Materials. Let's start with regulatory.

[ON "Regulatory Updates" tab]

> The **Course Module** tab is the deliverable hub — downloadable presentation, course document, and assessment quiz, all generated and ready to go.

[CLICK "Redline View"]

> The Redline View is the side-by-side diff. On the left, the original. On the right, the updated version. Green highlights show what was added. Red strikethrough shows what was removed. Every change has a citation — you can click through to the source.

[SCROLL through a redline card, point out a citation]

> And the **Fact Check** tab shows the verification results — each finding gets a confidence score and a source URL so you can audit the AI's work.

[CLICK "Fact Check" tab briefly]

---

## RESULTS — DESIGN TAB (25 seconds)

> Now let's flip to Design Materials.

[CLICK "Design Materials" tab]

> The **Study Guide** was generated with Google Search grounding — so the facts are verified, not hallucinated. You get structured sections, key points, and takeaway boxes. The first few sections are visible; the rest are behind an unlock gate for the paid tier.

[CLICK "Slides" tab]

> Here's the redesigned slide deck. Notice the typography, the layout variety, the theme we picked applied throughout. And this slide — the AI selected it as the best candidate for an infographic, then generated the image using Gemini's image model. Real visual content, not clip art.

[POINT to the infographic slide]

> And at the bottom of every slide, if the source had a disclaimer or copyright notice, it's preserved automatically.

[CLICK "Quiz" tab]

> Finally, the quiz — generated from the study guide sections, so the questions actually test what the study guide teaches. It's downloadable as an interactive HTML file.

---

## CLOSE (10 seconds)

> That's Course Correction. One file in, six agents, two complete outputs — regulatory compliance and visual modernization — in under a minute. Every fact cited, every change auditable, every deliverable downloadable.
>
> We built this for the teams that manage hundreds of courses and can't afford to let them rot. Thanks for watching.
